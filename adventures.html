              <h3>2023 Italian Dolomites</h3>
              <h5>Family Trip To The Dolomites</h5>
              <a href="images/adventureImages/dolomites.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="screenshot" src="images/adventureImages/dolomites.jpg" alt="dolomites image"></a>
              <p style="color: #87CEEB">In 2023 we took our campervan to the Italian Dolomites to have a family holiday. It was so nice to have a family
                holiday which we had not been able to have due to family commitments and that pesky covid 19.  We visited most of 
                the “touristy” areas in the Trentino – south Tyrol region before driving back into the south of France before 
                returning home. While we were in Italy we went on several treks at the Alp Du Susie, Cinque Torri, Lago di Brais, 
                Seseda and the Tr Cime di Lavaredo. For me the Cinque Torri and  Tre Cime di Lavaredo were the best locations in 
                this region. The breath taking landscape just kept me in awe. While heading to France we spent the night at a lovely
                vineyard, Poggio delle Grazie I can honestly say their wine and olive oil was the best I have ever tasted. 
                This family run business is well worth a visit if visiting the area. 
                
                <br>
                
                Once we got to France we decided to head for Sant Tropaz dreaming of lying on a sunny beach for a few days but 
                not thinking Hamish (our dog) would not be allowed on the beach. Still we were still able to have a present couple 
                of days visiting Sant Tropaz and Port Grimaud before driving home.

              <p>In 2019 after completing the Camino De Santiago my wife and I decided to push on to Finisterre. This Camino was 
                every bit as enjoyable as the Camino de Santiago and I feel finished off the trip in the best way. 
                
                <br>
                
                Another nice thing that occurred on this Camino was a few of the people we met on the Camino de Santiago also 
                continued to Finisterre and so we all met up and had one last meal and a few drinks together before we returned 
                to our home countries.

              <a href="images/adventureImages/caminoDeSantiago.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="screenshot" src="images/adventureImages/caminoDeSantiago.jpg" alt="Camino De Santiago image"></a>
              <p>In 2019 my wife and I decided to walk the Camino de Santiago via the Primitivo. This was an awesome experience 
                and on a personal note this trip was really important to me as I was going through a complex time in my personal 
                life and this trek allowed me to have time to reflect, meet some awesome people and see a part of the world I had 
                not seen before. The vision of walking in amazing Spanish sun every day was rudely interrupted by two days of 
                heavy rain, thankfully being a Scotsman well accustomed to rain this did not put too much of a dampener on things.
  
                <br>
                
                The Camino for me was an awesome experience and has left a lasting impression on my life.

              <h3>2018 Hong Kong</h3>
              <h5>Trip To Hong Kong</h5>
              <a href="images/adventureImages/hongKong.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="screenshot" src="images/adventureImages/hongKong.jpg" alt="Hong Kong image"></a>
              <p> In 2018 on an impulse my wife and I booked to visit Hong Kong and visit my brother in lay who at that time lived 
                in Macau. Hong Kong City was very interesting architecturally and I would visit again purely to marvel at the 
                temples. I’m not sure how I feel about all the shops selling traditional Chinese medicines as most of what has 
                hanging up originated from an endangered animal species although I respect that it is part of their culture. 
  
                <br>
                
                We also went on a trek to the Tian Tan Buddha passing the summit of Lantau which was great as it avoided the 
                crowds of people taking the gondola to the Buddha.  We also did several other treks around the Aberdeen and 
                Pok Fu Lam regions.
  
                <br>
  
                Macau Is not just Asia’s answer to Las Vagas but it too has some nice treks that

              <p> In 2018 this trip was very much a case of while we were attending a wedding in Monselice we thought we would visit Venice. I had heard very mixed reports of Venice and for me it was a nice city and well worth a visit (out of the tourist season). It is one of those cities where it is nice to wander up and down the narrow streets and just take in the culture. 
  
                <br>
                
                And yes I did wear my Kilt to the wedding!

              <h3>2017 Goa</h3>
              <h5>Honeymoon In Goa</h5>
              <a href="images/adventureImages/goa.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="screenshot" src="images/adventureImages/goa.jpg" alt="Goa image"></a>
              <p>In 2017 my wife and I went to Goa with for our honeymoon, Goa was like no other country I have been in and a different mindset had to be quickly adopted. 
                This holiday was a mixture of relaxing and adventure splitting our time between our hotel and day excursions to spice farms and areas of natural beauty. 
                As previously stated, a different mindset had to be quickly adopted and I truly believe failure to adopt the Goan mindset would result in injury. For example, 
                when crossing the road at a crossing the traffic does not stop it merely slows down and drives around you as you walk across the road.  Additionally, although 
                we were staying in a five star luxury hotel “light” electric shocks from power outlets were not infrequent and to be sitting having your breakfast while a member 
                of staff sprayed an insecticide around the edges of the dining area were just a few of the things we grew to accept as normal. Madness aside Goa is a truly 
                beautiful country and the people are very welcoming I hope to return one day to explore more of the secluded bays in the south of Goa.

              <p>My Trek up Kilimanjaro was as a fundraiser for a cancer charity in memory of my grandmother who died the previous year. I really enjoyed this trek and 
                I met people who I still keep inContact with to this day.

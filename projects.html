          <p class="project-discription">This project aimed to develop a desktop application to support users to manage their farming/agricultural business budget and, therefore, assist them to make informed management decisions. This is an area
            which have proven to be problematic at times due to poor organisational and time management skills, lack of understanding of the current market environment, poor record keeping and literacy issues which can impact on the understanding of info, market changes, usage of
            technology, difficulties in meeting deadlines for agricultural schemes and therefore, financial issues. Thus, this project intends to assist users with their budgeting and access to applications for governmental support schemes which
            are an important source of income within this industry. Finally, the program anticipated to be user friendly with people with literacy difficulties which is a wide problem identified in the farming/agriculture community. The project report can
